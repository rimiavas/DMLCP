  Data and machine learning for artistic practice (DMLAP)
  Regression example 2

  In this code we create colour markers on the screen, each time saving their
  coordinates and r,g,b values and providing them to our neural network.
  e.g. nnAddData(inputs, output); in mousePressed();

  Once we have enough points we call nnTrain(); this trains the neural network

  The demo will show a grid with all the colors predicted at each position.

  Instructions:
  - Click to place a point,
  - Press 1 to 3 to change the colour of the points
  - Press 't' to train the model

  All information to customise your neural network and training can be found here:
  https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/neural-network

  IDEA:
  - Can you find patterns where the neural net fails to capture the data?
  - Maybe you would like to develop this sketch to allow you to explore the different parameters
    of your network and of training more easily? One way of doing that would be to work with a
    GUI library like https://github.com/bitcraftlab/p5.gui
  - In this vein, one could imagine implementing ways to:
    - Show which class is currently selected (1, 2 or 3) somewhere on the canvas
    - Reset the neural network when pressing a key
    - Reset the datapoints when pressing another key
    - Show the prediction for the pixel under the mouse (draw an ellipse with the predicted color?)
    - If you wanted to save/load your data points, here's how to do it:

      // This will actually download a file.
      function saveData(path){
        saveJSON(data_points, './data.json');
      }

      // Loading and saving
      function loadData(path){
        function loaded(json){
          // Note: you might want to recreate your nn here (or not)
          data_points = json;              // Load existing data if any
          for (const data of data_points){ // if we have points add them
            let inputs = [data.x, data.y];
            let outputs = [data.r, data.g, data.b];
            nn.addData(inputs, outputs); // this adds the data to the neural network
          }
        }
        loadJSON(path, loaded);
      }

  // programming can be tricky. Luckily the "predictSync" function forces ML5js
  // to give us the result immediately and simplifies matters
  const res = nn.predictSync(input);

  // ML5 places each component of the prediction into an object.
  // As a result, the format of the output of a prediction is different from
  // the one given as training data. E.g. if we trained the network with one
  // input array [x] and an output array [a, b, c] one prediction will give
  // [{0:predicted_a, label: 0, value:predicted_a, unNormalizedValue: unnormalized_predicted_a},
  //  {1:predicted_b, label: 1, value:predicted_b, unNormalizedValue: unnormalized_predicted_b},
  //  {2:predicted_c, label: 2, value:predicted_c, unNormalizedValue: unnormalized_predicted_c}]
  // meaning that with "straight" ML5js we will need to parse these values and
  // put them into our preferred format (which is likely the one we provided in
  // the first place as training data).

  // If we provide an array of inputs (asking for multiple predictions),
  // predictedSync will return an array of such objects, so here we handle the
  // two cases making it consistent with the input format
  if (Array.isArray(input[0])){
    // multiple predictions
    return res.map(element => element.map(v => v.value));
  } else {
    // make one prediction
    return res.map(v => v.value);
  }
