  Data and machine learning for creative practice (DMLCP)
  Regression example 1

  In this code we create colour markers on the screen, each time saving their
  coordinates and r,g,b values and providing them to our neural network.
  e.g. nn.addData(inputs, output); in mousePressed();

  Once we have enough points we call nn.train(); this trains the neural network

  After it has trained we ask the neural network to predict the colour for the
  mouse coordinates (reflected in the square)

  Instructions:
  - Click to place a point,
  - Press 1 to 3 to chane the colour of the points
  - Press 't' to train the model

  IDEA: An experiment that could help you gain some practice with this NN system
        could be to try and implement two variants of this sketch: one that takes
        *one* input instead of two (for instance only the x or the y). You would
        need to make changes when you define your network, and whenever an input
        is fed into your nn. You could also try and imagine what system could take
        *three* inputs instead of two?
  IDEA: Similarly, nothing stops you from making the nn predict only one number,
        instead of three. Instead of having three different colours as we have here,
        you could define three different radius sizes for ellipses. You select which
        one using the numbers as above, and when you click to create data, you create
        an ellipse with that radius at that point. Then, you train your neural net to
        predict just this number, the radius, and when the model is trained, you could
        draw an ellipse with the predicted radius at that spot.

  const res = nn.predictSync(input);

  // ML5 places each component of the prediction into an object.
  // as a result, the format of the output of a prediction is different from the one given as training data
  // E.g. if we trained the network with one input array [x] and an output array [a, b, c] one prediction will give
  // [{0:predicted_a, label: 0, value:predicted_a, unNormalizedValue: unnormalized_predicted_a},
  //  {1:predicted_b, label: 1, value:predicted_b, unNormalizedValue: unnormalized_predicted_b},
  //  {2:predicted_c, label: 2, value:predicted_c, unNormalizedValue: unnormalized_predicted_c}]
  // meaning that with "straight" ML5js we will need to parse these values and put them into our preferred format
  // (which is likely the one we provided in the first place as training data).
  //
  // If we provide an array of inputs (asking for multiple predictions), predictedSync will return an array of such objects, so here we handle the two cases

  // making it consistent with the input format
  if (Array.isArray(input[0])){
    // multiple predictions
    return res.map(element => element.map(v => v.value));
