    "`tiny_shakespeare` is obviously not the only dataset availabe on the Hub. Another example I came across a few times recently is the [`english_quotes` dataset by Abirate](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Abirate/english_quotes). You can load it like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataset_raw = load_dataset(\"Abirate/english_quotes\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The one thing to watch out for is that the text lives in `\"quote\"`, not in `\"text\"`! Your `tokenize_function`, for instance, should then work on `examples[\"quote\"]` rather than `examples[\"text\"]`, and so does the rest of this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Freezing layers\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy to save memory and to reduce the impact of fine-tuning is to finetune only *some* layers of the model (usually the top-ones, leaving the base 'frozen'). You can achieve that by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Looking at a list of all your layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i, (name, params) in enumerate(model.named_parameters()):\n",
    "    print(i, name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Setting the `.requires_grad` attribute to `False` for most layers (here I just loop through them and freeze the first 122 layers (see [this link](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/freeze-lower-layers-with-auto-classification-model/11386/2)):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "layer_threshold = 122\n",
    "for i, (name, params) in enumerate(model.named_parameters()):\n",
    "    if i < layer_threshold:\n",
    "        # print(f\"freezing: {name}\")\n",
    "        params.requires_grad = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing this, you can notice that the memory footprint of the model is much less big on the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with raw text files\n",
    "\n",
    "To load data from a file or a directory, see [this reference](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/nlp_load).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various options available, either manually download the file, for instance like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# let's download the tiny shakespeare dataset manually\n",
    "dataset_dir = \"text-dataset\"\n",
    "if not os.path.isdir(dataset_dir):\n",
    "    os.mkdir(dataset_dir)\n",
    "\n",
    "# move into the directory and download the file\n",
    "os.chdir(dataset_dir)\n",
    "!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt\n",
    "os.chdir('..')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can load the dataset from the directory we created:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataset_raw_from_dir = load_dataset(\n",
    "    \"text\", # in this case we need \"text\" as a generic name to specify the task\n",
    "    data_dir=dataset_dir,\n",
    "    sample_by=\"document\"  # we indicate we want the whole text\n",
    ")                         # the default is line by line, \"paragraph\" cuts on empty lines\n",
    "# print(dataset_raw_from_dir[\"train\"][\"text\"][0][:250])\n",
    "print(len(dataset_raw_from_dir[\"train\"][\"text\"][0]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the code above, `load_dataset` is usable if you have more than one files. You can also select which files go where like so: `data_files={\"train\": \"text-dataset/input.txt\"}`. Even more, you could skip the above step and just do `data_files=='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we load raw files, the train/validation/test split is not done for us. *If you wanted to do this* (you could also not care about a validation dataset and just have \"train\", you wouldn't be the first person to do this), for this one file, you would do it this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# adapted from ChatGPT-4 output\n",
    "from datasets import Dataset, DatasetDict\n",
    "\n",
    "def split_text_dataset(dataset, train_percent=0.9, validation_percent=0.05):\n",
    "    # Retrieve all texts\n",
    "    full_text = '\\n'.join(dataset[\"train\"][\"text\"])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Calculate split lengths\n",
    "    total_length = len(full_text)\n",
    "    train_length = int(total_length * train_percent)\n",
    "    validation_length = int(total_length * validation_percent)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Split the text\n",
    "    train_text = full_text[:train_length]\n",
    "    validation_text = full_text[train_length:train_length + validation_length]\n",
    "    test_text = full_text[train_length + validation_length:]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Combine into a DatasetDict\n",
    "    return DatasetDict({\n",
    "        'train': Dataset.from_dict({'text': [train_text]}),\n",
    "        'validation': Dataset.from_dict({'text': [validation_text]}),\n",
    "        'test': Dataset.from_dict({'text': [test_text]})\n",
    "    })\n",
    "\n",
    "dataset_raw = split_text_dataset(dataset_raw_from_dir)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our dataset is almost the same as the one downloaded from the Hub:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(dataset_raw)\n",
    "print([(split, len(dataset_raw[split]['text'][0])) for split in dataset_raw])\n",
    "print(dataset_raw['train']['text'][0][:250])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "If you want to see how deep the rabbit hole goes, I can only recommend [this Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JMLa53HDuA-i7ZBmqV7ZnA3c_fvtXnx-?usp=sharing#scrollTo=2c5V0FvqseE0) by the same Karpathy, accompanying [his tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) (I highly recommend this series on building language models from scratch!)."
