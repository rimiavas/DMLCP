    "# Canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "To aid creative applications of machine learning models built in Python, [Daniel Berio](https://www.enist.org/post/) and [Irini Kalaitzidi](https://irinikalaitzidi.com) created a small `Canvas` class that mimics the interface of P5js by using Python in combination with the [Cairo drawing interface](https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_NOTE:_**  The canvas module is not an extensively tested system. It is intended to facilitate creating images in Python with an interface that is familiar to Processing/P5js users. But you should eventually familiarize yourself with other more widely used drawing API's, such as Matplotlib or pyCairo. In other words, you should consider it a \"gateway API\" to these more complex systems that you will often encounter when looking at machine learning code available on the web. Don't hesitate to contact Danel if you find any bugs or unexpected behaviors, by email or by posting an \"Issue\" on github at this [link](https://github.com/colormotor/DMLCP/issues). Currently the API does not support all the same functions as P5js. We will add more functionalities as we go, so make sure you update your copy of the `canvas.py` file regularly to include new features and bug fixes!."

    "-   The naming convention uses `snake_case` rather than `camelCase`. That is, we use underscores to separate terms rather than capitalization. So for example the equivalent of the p5js `strokeWeight(...)` is `stroke_weight(...)`. This is convention is pretty much a standard in Python code.\n",
    "-   Text rendering uses a slightly different syntax. The position to the `text` function is passed as a list (or numpy array) rather than two values following the string and alignment is specified as an (optional) string parameter to the same function.\n",
    "-   Finally, we need to create a `Canvas` object for this system to work, so all the commands that you would usually write in the p5js editor need to have the reference to the canvas object prepended (e.g. `c.stroke(255)` rather than `stroke(255)` for a white stroke). Here we are calling the object `c` for brevity. You can picture the `c = Canvas(width, height)` as equivalent to `createCanvas(width, height)` in p5js.\n"
